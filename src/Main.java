        * bind an Action to a KeyStroke
        * they do not require you to click a component to give it focus
        * Swing components are capable to use Key Bindings
        * increased flexibility compared to KeyListeners
        * can assign KeyStrokes to individual Swing components (Player 1 and Player 2 for example)
        * more difficult to utilize and set up
